I will be using statistical model such as a Random Forrest Statistical Model to find which data attribute has an influence on the term deposit decision. I will also be using bar graph to show which variables that has the most relevance to the term deposit and also to show the relationship between age and deposit. (Note this is my first kaggle notebook. I am planning on updating this document whenever I got some free time from school.)\n","\n","# Main Finding\n","* **Age** seems to have the highest feature importance so it may be important to look at the relationship with the different age demographic with the term deposit.\n","* Most of our client had declined the term deposit. Out of all of our client(**41,188 individuals**), only **4640** (**11.3%**) of them accepted the term deposit.\n","* Majority of our client fall in the **adult(30-60 years old)** age range. Out of the total **32,895** adult client, only **3,102(9.43%)** of them accepted the term deposit.\n","\n","\n","# Background\n","**What is a term deposit?**\n","\n","\" A term deposit is a fixed-term investment that includes the deposit of money into an account at a financial institution. Term deposit investments usually carry short-term maturities ranging from one month to a few years and will have varying levels of required minimum deposits. \" - [Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/termdeposit.asp)\n","## Here are the variables we will be looking at:\n","\n","### Bank Client Data:\n","1 - **age**: (numeric)\n","\n","2 - **job**: type of job (categorical: 'admin.','blue-collar','entrepreneur','housemaid','management','retired','self-employed','services','student','technician','unemployed','unknown')\n","\n","3 - **marital**: marital status (categorical: 'divorced','married','single','unknown'; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)\n","\n","4 - **education**: (categorical: primary, secondary, tertiary and unknown)\n","\n","5 - **default**: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n","\n","6 - **housing**: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n","\n","7 - **loan**: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no','yes','unknown')\n","\n","### Related with the last contact of the current campaign:\n","8 - **contact**: contact communication type (categorical: 'cellular','telephone')\n","\n","9 - **month**: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar', ..., 'nov', 'dec')\n","\n","10 - **day**: last contact day of the week (categorical: 'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')\n","\n","11 - **duration**: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.\n","\n","### Other Attributes:\n","12 - **campaign**: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)\n","\n","13 - **pdays**: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)\n","\n","14 - **previous**: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)\n","\n","15 - **poutcome**: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: 'failure','nonexistent','success')\n","### social and economic context attributes\n","16 - **emp.var.rate**: employment variation rate - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","17 - **cons.price.idx**: consumer price index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","18 - **cons.conf.idx**: consumer confidence index - monthly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","19 - **euribor3m**: euribor 3 month rate - daily indicator (numeric)\n","\n","20 - **nr.employed**: number of employees - quarterly indicator (numeric)\n","\n","### Output variable (desired target):\n","21 - **y** - has the client subscribed a term deposit?

I also learned how to do some data preparation concepts such as binning,filter all the variables that are important for our analysis using the copy function, and change categorical values to numerical values using the astype function and cat code function.  By utilizing these concepts and applying them to this bank dataset, we found that age has the highest correlation with the term deposit, most our client fall in the adult age group,and that most of our client didn’t accept the term deposit. \n","\n","A couple of things that I probably want to implement if I had more time is to plot the age/deposit scatter plot; showing the linear regresion relationship between age, job, education, and deposit; and to further explore the month/deposit relationship. The reason why I might want to implement the scatterplot is to see if age has a direct relationship with the term deposit, meaning that if the age increases the term deposit should increase. If we plot this scattergraph, we can learn who our main demographic might be and adjust our marketing campaign and contact method for their need. The reason why I might want to show the linear regression relationship is to see if the the different type of job and education has an influence to the client decision to accept the term deposit or not. I believe each different age group has a reason why they didn’t want to accept the term deposit so by comparing these variables together we can see the different motive we can use to persuade the client to accept the term deposit. Since month has the second highest importance in the Randome Tree Model, it is probably recommended to explore the month/deposit relationship and see which month would be best to contact our client.\n","\n"]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.7.12"},"papermill":{"default_parameters":{},"duration":47.216856,"end_time":"2022-06-07T05:15:47.390974","environment_variables":{},"exception":null,"input_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","output_path":"__notebook__.ipynb","parameters":{},"start_time":"2022-06-07T05:15:00.174118","version":"2.3.3"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
